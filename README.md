Angular2 Sandbox
====
* This sandbox is inspired by [AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)
* The following things are removed (there may be more deletions):
 * Test code (everything related to karma, jasmine, protractor, typings for these frameworks etc)
 * Almost all package.json scripts
 * Typedoc
* The following things are added:
 * (none yet)
* Todo:
 * Bootstrap3 (bootstrap4 and ng2-material are in too early stages atm)
 * jQuery
 * Extended with an MVC6 server (maybe delete node server code?)
 * Sweet alerts?
